# Blossom UI

Blossom has been built for the ground up to provide an easy way for beginner and advanced web designers and developers to get their hands on a simple but powerful design framework. With a massive library of web elements, Blossom allows users to build & design intuitive websites efficiently.

### Elements
The [Elements section](http://getblossom.io/elements/buttons) provides a vast range of elements needed to build a site from scratch; ranging from buttons to progress bars, you have all the building blocks needed to make a truly unique page.

Just hover over the element you want to use and click the _code_ icon. You'll see the HTML markup needed to clone the element for your website.

### Design
The [Design section](http://getblossom.io/elements/buttons) gives you all the helper classes needed to make a customized layout. Use the [12 Column Grid](http://getblossom.io/design/grid) to make the basic structure of your page.

Make sure to start planning for mobile versions from the start by using several grid classes and breakpoints on your elements.

### Utility
The [Utility section](http://getblossom.io/utility/js) provides additional helper classes and methods to add that next level of detail to your page.

Ensure that you use Blossom JS as mentioned in the section to get your Progress Bars and Dropdowns working correctly.

### Theming
Most theming can be achieved by editing the `variables.styl` file within Blossom's `src` folder. Changing single variables will have an effect across your whole website so try to experiment from the start to see what suits your site the most.

A more extensive guide on theming will be released in the near future.

### Issues
Found any issues with the build? Make sure you let me know by posting an issue.
